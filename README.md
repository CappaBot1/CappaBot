# CappaBot
This is the newest version of CappaBot  
"Why make a new bot when you already have made one that works" you may ask  
Because now I am using javascript  
That's about it  
***
I used the discord bot template [repository](https://github.com/discord/discord-example-app) to aid in the production of this bot

If, for some odd reason, you want to use this bot you need to:
- Run `npm install` in this directory
- Replace the necessary `replaceThisWithX` with actual values
